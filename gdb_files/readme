What does it do?
It will generate all the functions that are called during the debugging and log it in the
specified file. While logging it will move through code automatically.

How to use?
Open 'rtt.py' and specify the file ('fnexcl.res') path. Search for 'exclusion_file' variable.
In your .gdbinit file (create if not there) located in you home directory add the following:
source <location to rtt.py>

Start gdb
    - Reach the position that you want the logging to start
    - run 'rtt <file name>' in gdb. This might take some time if your code is long.
